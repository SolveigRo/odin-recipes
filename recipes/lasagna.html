        <li>Dice the bacon into small pieces. Heat the oil in a pan and cook the bacon until golden. Remove the bacon from the pan.</li>
        <li>Add a bit of oil. Using high heat, brown the ground beef in two rounds. Remove the ground beef from the pan.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium and add onion, carrot, and celery. Let it cook till the veggies are soft and shiny.</li>
        <li>Add the bacon and beef back to the pan. Make room in the middle of the pan, add some oil, and fry the tomato paste for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add canned tomatoes, broth, and spices. Let it cook for at least 10 minutes. 
            If you have more time, let it cook on low heat under lid for a few hours. 
            Remember to stir a few times. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.</li>
        <li>In another pot, melt the butter. Stir in the flour. While stirring, add the milk a bit at a time.
            Let it carefully boil for 10 minutes, remember to stir! The sauce should be pretty thick.
